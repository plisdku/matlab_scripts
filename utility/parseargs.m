function X = parseargs(X,varargin)
%PARSEARGS - Parses name-value pairs
%
% Behaves like setfield, but accepts multiple name-value pairs and provides
% some additional features:
% 1) If any field of X is an cell-array of strings, it can only be set to
%    one of those strings.  If no value is specified for that field, the
%    first string is selected.
% 2) Where the field is not empty, its data type cannot be changed
% 3) Where the field contains a scalar, its size cannot be changed.
%
% X = parseargs(X,name1,value1,name2,value2,...) 
%
% Intended for use as an argument parser for functions which multiple options.
% Example usage:
%
% function my_function(varargin)
%   X.StartValue = 0;
%   X.StopOnError = false;
%   X.SolverType = {'fixedstep','variablestep'};
%   X.OutputFile = 'out.txt';
%   X = parseargs(X,varargin{:});
%
% Then call (e.g.):
%
% my_function('OutputFile','out2.txt','SolverType','variablestep');
